## Kamoica c'est moi

**I'm a graphic design student trying to learn as much things as possible before the end of my third year, because I will soon need to find a job. This will be tough.**

My ultimate goal is to become great at everything I do on the first try. Unfortunately, this is not doable. Also, I'm kind of slow. So I guess I will have to spend some time working on things.
Some of my current projects may include :
- the **greatest** online frog museum
- a very basic 2D platform game displaying my cat Malo as the main character
- some online postcards for my friends and professors
